  I would like to solve the following Burgers equation: \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \nu\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}
  Where, \nu=0.01
  The computational geometry domain is [-1,1], and the time domain is [0,1]
  The initial condition \quad u(x,0) = - \sin(\pi x)
  The Dirichlet boundary condition u(-1,t)=u(1,t)=0
  The PDE does not have analytical solution.
