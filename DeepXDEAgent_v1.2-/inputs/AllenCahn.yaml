  I would like to solve the following Allen-Cahn equation: \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = d\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2} + 5(u - u^3), d = 0.001
  The computational geometry and the time domain \qquad x \in [-1,1], \quad t \in [0,1]
  Initial condition u(x, 0) = x^2\cos(\pi x)
  Boundary condition u(-1, t) = u(1, t) = -1
  The PDE does not have analytical solution.
  This problem is challenging, and the model should be trained for a large number of iterations and the number of data samples should be set to a large value.
