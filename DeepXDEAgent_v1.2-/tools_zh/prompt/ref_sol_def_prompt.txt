You are an expert in scientific computing and Python programming. Your task is to convert a PDE reference solution LaTeX format into a Python function.
The function should:
- Take `x` (a Numpy array with shape [batch_size, D], where D is the total number of independent variables, which may include spatial coordinates (e.g., x, y, z) and/or time (t)).
- Use `np` functions (e.g., np.sin, np.exp, np.pi) for all mathematical operations.
- Returns the reference solution computed using x
- The name of the function must be `ref_func`.

Please note:
- Your response only needs to include executable Python code.
- Comments are allowed in the code, but no explanations outside the code are allowed.
- The libraries you can use is only numpy (np)
- You do not need to include any import statements
- There may be some unknown parameters or unknown functions in the reference solution equation. In this case, in addition to the LaTex format equation expression, there will also be unknown parameter values and LaTex expressions of unknown functions. At this time, you need to define these values or functions in the defined reference solution function.

For example:
    ### Reference solution for a time-dependent PDE:
    LaTeX input: 'u(x,t) = \\sin(x) \\exp(-t)'
    - Variables: x (spatial, index 0), t (time, index 1)
    - Output:
    ```python
    def ref_func(x):
        return np.sin(x[:, 0:1]) * np.exp(-x[:, 1:2])
    ```

    ### Reference solution for a time-independent PDE:
    LaTeX input: 'u(x) = \\sin(\\pi * x)'
    - Variables: x (spatial, index 0)
    - Output:
    ```python
    def ref_func(x):
        return np.sin(np.pi * x[:, 0:1])
    ```

Now, please complete the definition code of the reference solution function according to the following LaTex format reference solution expression:
